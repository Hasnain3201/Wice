Currently serving as the Project Management Specialist and Senior Population and Family Health Advisor at USAID/Jordan, I lead efforts to expand access to and improve the quality of Jordan's health system, working closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH), USAID/Washington, development partners, and implementing agencies.

I provide high-level strategic and technical guidance across areas including primary healthcare, reproductive health, maternal and child health, gender-based violence (GBV), and health governance. I have been instrumental in key achievements, including the accreditation of 100 primary healthcare centers in Jordan for the first time, and played a central role in designing and managing programs that support Syrian refugees and vulnerable Jordanians, particularly in sexual and reproductive health and GBV response.

A cornerstone of my work is donor coordination and partnership building. I was a key architect of the Jordan Health Development Partners Forum and helped establish a multi-donor trust fund to enhance healthcare access for refugees, demonstrating my strength in fostering inter-agency collaboration and mobilizing resources in complex, multi-stakeholder environments.

My previous roles include Emergency Reproductive Health Officer at UNFPA, where I managed emergency preparedness and response in humanitarian settings; Technical Field Coordinator with Abt Associates, leading field operations for health systems projects; and Clinical Skills Supervisor at the University of Jordan, where I was responsible for training and quality assurance in medical education. I began my career as a Staff Nurse at Jordan University Hospital, which grounded my commitment to frontline health delivery.

I hold a Master’s in Public Health (MPH) and a Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSc) from the University of Jordan, and am a certified Project Management Professional (PMP). My technical expertise is complemented by continuous professional development in digital health, gender-based programming, and results-based management.

Throughout my career, I have represented my organizations in national technical working groups, policy forums, and global health platforms. I’ve contributed to public health publications and policy dialogue, and have been recognized with awards for leadership in vaccine modernization, donor alignment, and health systems innovation.

I am now seeking leadership roles where I can apply my deep knowledge of public health systems, strategic planning, and operational leadership to drive impactful health programming in development or humanitarian settings.

As a former U.S. diplomat with USAID, she has held pivotal roles in mission strategy, international communications, and program development and management in challenging environments, including Belarus, Egypt, and Pakistan. Her work has consistently centered on amplifying local voices, building resilient systems, and creating inclusive spaces for collaboration.

Victoria blends deep technical knowledge in governance, civil society, and human rights with a proven ability to manage interagency coordination, policy engagement, and crisis response. She led USAID Belarus during a time of historic upheaval, coordinating cross-sectoral support to pro-democracy actors while maintaining operational continuity under extreme pressure.

I specialize in designing programs, facilitating MEL systems, and advancing climate resilience, food systems, and inclusive development through evidence-based methods. I’ve led dozens of major program designs, revised country strategies, built adaptive MEL systems that continue functioning long after my departure, and successfully drafted proposals that secured millions of dollars in funding.

As a consultant, I bring calm, collaborative leadership to fast-moving assignments. I’ve chaired more than 60 technical evaluation committees for WASH, climate, and food system awards, structured cross-sector design teams, and filled capacity gaps through strategic facilitation and targeted input. In Albania, I led consultations for agriculture and eco-tourism programs aligned with EU climate goals. In Zambia, I oversaw the co-creation of integrated private sector partnerships in conservation, clean energy, and rural enterprise, resulting in more than $90 million in leveraged commitments.

My approach to MEL focuses on making learning automatic and meaningful for project staff and managers. I believe effective MEL begins with communication and relationship-building. I created a quarterly technical review process that promoted peer-based reflection and course correction, now used across multiple USAID Missions. I also facilitated a 135-person learning event in Zambia that challenged core assumptions and directly informed new program designs. I have embedded MEL into proposal review, humanitarian resource reallocation, and staff capacity development, always emphasizing practical utility and inclusion.

I bring deep experience in climate and environmental systems, grounded in advanced degrees in environmental science. In Zambia, I led a landscape-scale strategy across 17 chiefdoms that aligned agriculture, conservation, and eco-tourism, while leveraging $22 million in private partnerships. I partnered with venture capital firms to mobilize $31 million in climate-smart investments and contributed to U.S. efforts to launch a $500 million carbon credit platform. In all of these efforts, I’ve helped communities build trust in conservation by linking climate finance directly to livelihoods.

In food systems and agriculture, I’ve led program realignments during global supply shocks, helped structure regional fertilizer and trade responses, and designed inclusive value chain investments. In Bangladesh, I oversaw a $230 million food security program shift to support displaced ethnic minorities, balancing inclusion with technical quality.

I’ve also introduced institutional reforms such as requiring local representation on proposal panels and convening quarterly learning sessions with civil society and technical experts. I’ve mentored local staff to lead $70 million in programming and helped raise $3 million for locally led outreach and design workshops.

In addition to my technical background, I bring strong writing and facilitation skills. I’ve led trainings for CEOs, farmers, and field staff, and was selected by the U.S. Ambassador to facilitate a strategic retreat for interagency teams.
